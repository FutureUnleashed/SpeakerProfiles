Aparna’s first encounter with Windows app development was through the ‘I Unlock Joy’ and ‘Imagine Cup’ competitions when at college. Since then, she has carved a niche for herself in Windows application development both for gaming and utility apps. Currently, she has a cool job in the Windows app consult team at Microsoft where she assists developers in developing/improving their apps by giving guidance on architecture, design, performance and monitory benefits. She likes teaching and has conducted several workshops on Windows App development. A voracious reader, she plans to own a library one day. She watches TV series/sitcoms when free.
